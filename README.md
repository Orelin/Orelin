  ## About Me

  I started in frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and evolved toward building
  practical tools focused on image processing and automation.

  I currently build Python pipelines designed to solve real-world problems, not just to experiment
  with models.

  I work with super-resolution and restoration models integrated into reproducible, parameterized
  workflows.

  I also have hands-on experience in hardware repair and diagnostics, which strengthens my systematic
  approach to technical problem-solving.

  English level: **B1**.

  My frontend stage gave me solid foundations in structure, code organization, and data flow
  understanding. Today, I apply those fundamentals to systems focused on processing and automation.

  ## Current Project

  ### Photo Restoration Pipeline *(private)*

  I am developing a Python application/pipeline for restoring old photographs, focused on:

  - Automated and repeatable workflow
  - Super-resolution model integration (Real-ESRGAN)
  - Face restoration with CodeFormer
  - Parameter tuning for sharpness, denoise, and scaling
  - Batch processing
  - Clear separation between preprocessing, restoration, and postprocessing

  The goal is not to generate new images, but to improve existing material while preserving visual
  coherence and maintaining technical control over the process.

  ## Professional Focus

  I’m interested in applied software engineering: building useful tools where AI is not the end goal,
  but a component within a structured system.

  I’m currently focused on growing in:

  - Robust automation
  - Reproducible pipeline design
  - Practical computer vision model integration
  - Process optimization for real-world usage
