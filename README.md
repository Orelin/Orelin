  ## About Me

  I started in frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and later moved into building
  practical tools focused on image processing and automation.

  I currently build Python pipelines aimed at solving real problems through reproducible,
  parameterized workflows.

  I also have hands-on experience in hardware diagnostics and repair, which reinforces a systematic
  approach to technical problem-solving.

  English level: **B1**.

  ## Technical Foundation

  icons" />
  </p>

  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - React
  - SQL (relational databases)
  - Version control fundamentals

  My frontend stage gave me solid foundations in structure, code organization, and data flow. Today, I
  apply those fundamentals to systems focused on processing and automation.

  ## Current Project

  ### Photo Restoration Pipeline *(private)*

  I am developing a Python application/pipeline for restoring old photos, focused on:

  - Automated and repeatable workflow
  - Super-resolution integration (Real-ESRGAN)
  - Face restoration with CodeFormer
  - Parameter tuning for sharpness, denoise, and scaling
  - Batch processing
  - Clear separation between preprocessing, restoration, and postprocessing

  The goal is not to generate new images, but to improve existing material while preserving visual
  consistency and technical control.

  ## Professional Focus

  I focus on building useful software where AI is a practical component inside a structured system.

  Current areas of growth:

  - Robust automation
  - Reproducible pipeline design
  - Practical computer vision model integration
  - Process optimization for real-world use
